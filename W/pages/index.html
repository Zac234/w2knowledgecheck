    <h2>My Favorite thing</h2>
    <p>I have always had a passion for technology, whether it be video games or the way t interacts with the world. Now as we are in the 2020's I see it more and more used as a practial part of day to day life with some people not even knowing how it all works. One day I hope that the knowledge of technology and the science around it will be accessible to all.

    <h2>My favorite movie</h2>
    <p>I don't really have a favorite movie, like I have movies that I will always go back to but none of the are really considered a favorite of mine</p>
